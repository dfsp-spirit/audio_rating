## About

This is a small javascript web widget to allow users to play an audio file, visualize the waveform, and assign ratings to the sections of the audio. The user can create sections, and assign a discrete rating to each section.

The widget support several rating dimensions, so that users can rate, for example, valence, arousal, and enjoyment.

It is intended to be used in psychological research on music perception and based on the great [wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer.xyz/) audio visualization library for JavaScript.


## Features

* audio file format: supports all audio file formats supported by Wavesurfer, including `.wav`, .`mp3`, and many others
* audio playback: pause/continue and jump to arbitrary positions in audio file via a slider
* rating: split songs into arbitrary sections and rate each section
* rate different dimensions (e.g., valence, arousal, and enjoyment) and use different scales for them
* interactive and iterative rating possible: replay a section, then rate it, switch back and forth between dimensions freely while rating, etc.
* export rating data and download it directly as a CSV file


## Online Live Demo

## Running the frontend locally

All you need is to have Python installed. Then, in the `frontend/` directory, either run the `run.bash` script or type `python -m http.server 8000`, which will serve the frontend in Python's built-in web server on port 8000 on your computer. Then connect to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

If you don't have Python or don't like its web server, use any other web server instead, e.g., nginx or apache2.

## Development Info regarding Caching

Warning: Because the JS is in a different file, you may see outdated versions during development due to browser caching!

Make sure to use devtools and on the `Networks` tab, set the tick at `Disable Cache`, or explicitely tell your browser to not cache when refreshing (e.g., press `CTRL` + `F5` instead of just `F5` under Linux/Firefox, but how to achieve this may differ by browser and OS). Even better, use a web server with auto-refresh.
