# Development nginx.conf for local testing of FastAPI backend with a reverse proxy setup.
#
# Use this file with the command:
#   nginx -c /path/to/dev.nginx.conf
# This config assumes your FastAPI backend is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 and that you want to access it via http://localhost/ar_backend/.
#
# The advantage of using nginx as a reverse proxy in development is that it closely mimics the production environment, allowing you to catch issues related to path handling, headers, and WebSocket support early on.
#
# Remember to replace the hardcoded paths to user home (in several places!) with the actual paths on your system.
# We need to adapt various settings to ensure that nginx can run without root privileges and that logs and pid files are stored in user-writable locations.
